Data and code repo for West Coast Region - Deep Sea Coral and Sponge cruises


We have our work cut out for us! This repo is meant to house both data and code related to  WCR_DSCS cruises that took place over the last several years. 

First things first: [Fieldwork Data and Reporting Guidance](https://deepseacoraldata.noaa.gov/internal-documents/program-guidance/science-team-guidance-for-data-management)

For now, I've set up a folder called `data_submission_FAQs`to house related documents, and another folder called `OCNMS_video_transects` with all of Tom Laidig's transect data. 

Here we go!!!
